# Anthropic OpenAPI spec

Repository created while waiting for the official OpenAPI spec from the Anthropic.

There are two versions of the spec:

**hosted_spec.json** - (Recommended) Specification taken from Antrhopic's official TypeScript SDK - https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-typescript/blob/main/.stats.yml. Unfortunately, it isn't "officially" exposed, nor easy to find, so this repo aims to help point at it.
**stiched_spec.yaml** - The spec is semi-automatically created by pointing Perplexity to each page on https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/ and asking to generate the spec. Then, all were stitched together and eye-balled verified.

## F.A.Q.

## Are there any other resources?

Yes, here are other:
